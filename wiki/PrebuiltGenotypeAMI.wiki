#summary How to use the pre-built AMIs to get up and running

= Introduction =

To demonstrate the genotype list service, we have made two AMIs available -- one with preloaded imgt-hla data, and one without any preloaded data.


= Details =

* Finding the AMIs *
  The preloaded and data-free AMIs are available in both East and West (Oregon) regions of Amazon.
 <ul>
<li>West/Oregon
<ul>
<li>ami-57069467 includes preloaded imgt-hla data</li>
<li>ami-cf0193ff does not include preloaded imgt-hla data.</li>
</ul></li>
 <li> East/Virginia
<ul>
<li>ami-54b7f03d includes preloaded imgt-hla data</li>
<li>ami-24b7f04d does not include preloaded imgt-hla data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

* Using the AMIs *

Launch a new machine using the AMI, but from the quick-launch wizard, you'll want to do a few things
<ol>
<li>set your namespace in the "user details" section, as shown in the screenshot below.  You'll want to set it thusly:
NAMESPACE=domainname.that.points.to.your.public.ip
Note that the setting up DNS is beyond the scope of this document.</ol>
<li>Set your security group to allow inbound ssh and http traffic.  If you want https traffic, we recommend you put your certificate on an Elastic Load Balancer, and terminate the SSL traffic there.  Contact Jeremy Anderson, janders3@nmdp.org, for more information on that.</li>
</ol>
