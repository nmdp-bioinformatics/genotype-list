<br/>
== Cache ==

The simplest deployment option is to use the RAM-only cache implementation provided by the gl-service module.  This option does not provide any persistence.

== JDBC + RDS ==

The genotype list service with the gl-service-jdbc module can be configured and deployed against the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) managed MySQL database service.

<br/>
== JDBC + MySQL ==

The genotype list service with the gl-service-jdbc module can also be configured and deployed against one or more MySQL database(s) on one or more EC2 instance(s) with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for file storage.

<br/>
== Redis ==

The genotype list service with the gl-service-redis module can be configured and deployed against a Redis distributed cache deployed to one or more EC2 instance(s) with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for file storage.

<br/>
== Voldemort ==

The genotype list service with the gl-service-voldemort module can be configured and deployed against a Voldemort distributed cache deployed to one or more EC2 instance(s) with Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) for file storage.  The MySQL Voldemort Store is not appropriate for the genotype list service, since its minimum key size is too small.  The Berkeley DB (BDB) Voldemort Store has a reasonable maximum key size.
