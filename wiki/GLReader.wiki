rename to GL String GL Reader?


The GL Service utilizes the {{{GlStringGlReader}}} to read a glstring and return an object and a URI.

In brief, the reader:
 * Checks whether the GL String has an ID by calling the glstringResolver and idResolver
 * Registers the GL String if the ID/object doesn't exist 
   * Recursively reads smaller and smaller pieces based on the [delimiters], resolving and registering new objects along the way.   
 * Returns the object

==How it Works==
===Resolving IDs===
The computation involved with resolving IDs is handled primarily by the {{{glStringResolver}}} and {{{idResolver}}}. 

The resolvers are called as follows:
{{{
final String id = glstringResolver.resolveLocus(glstring);
Locus locus = idResolver.findLocus(id);
}}}
where {{{Locus}}} is replaced by any [datatype].

We'll leave the details about the Resolvers for a separate page, so let's just talk about what this means to the Reader.

 * If the glstring/ID already exists, its object is returned.
 * If the glstring/ID does not exist, it needs to be registered, but first we check to see if any of its components have already been registered by recursing.

===Recursive Reading===

Recursive reading happens/The reader recurses when the glstring and ID do not already exist in the cache, or when the resolver times out. 
Since each object [Datatypes contains a list of its components], we need to make sure that all of its components are also registered.

====Special cases:====

{{{Locus}}}
  Since the locus is the smallest possible datatype, 

{{{Alleles}}}

====All other cases:====

The GL String is split into components by its [delimiters]. For example, the {{{MultilocusUnphasedGenotype}}} splits the string into {{{GenotypeLists}}} wherever there is a {{{^}}}. Continuing this example, the reader then calls {{{readGenotypeList(genotypeListPart;}}} <fixme need to add info>
