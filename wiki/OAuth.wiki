#summary OAuth 2.0 support

= Introduction =

Basic functionality has been implemented for [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750 OAuth 2.0 Bearer Tokens]. 
(see [https://code.google.com/p/genotype-list/issues/detail?id=25 Issue:25])

==TODO==
  * more documenation
  * more hardening
  * more tests

gl-oauth-apache components are in green.
|| !ServletFilter || an application specific Filter that is responsible for initializing and configuring the OAuth components. ||
|| !ScopeEvaluator || responsible for determining the !RequestScope ||
|| !TokenValidator || responsible for providing the !AccessTokenDetails like the scope and the realm ||
|| Authorizer || responsible for determining if the !AccessTokenDetails have the rights to perform the !RequestScope ||
|| !AuthorizedHooks || hooks that allow an application to update the !ServletRequest or Thread with authorization information ||

= Details =
The *toy-portal* webapp acts as the authorization server, but it has no authentication support.  The users and scopes are configured in the userid-scopes.txt file like

{{{
id=john,realm=immunogenomics,duration=3600,scope=locus
id=adam,realm=immunogenomics,duration=3600,scope=load allele admin
id=eve,realm=immunogenomics,duration=3600,scope=other
id=john,realm=toy,duration=3600,scope=read
id=adam,realm=toy,duration=3600,scope=write read admin POST
id=eve,realm=toy,duration=3600,scope=none
}}}

= Testing =
To build and launch wars
{{{
## at trunk
mvn install 
cd gl-jetty
mvn jetty:run
}}}

Perform POST operations to interact with authorization server.
{{{
$ curl -d "" "http://localhost:8080/toy-portal/oauth/get_token?userid=adam&realm=immunogenomics" ;echo
-jf9aqvkt9o6x
$ curl -d "" "http://localhost:8080/toy-portal/oauth/validate?token=-jf9aqvkt9o6x" ;echo
expires_in=3522,id=adam,duration=3600,realm=immunogenomics,scope=load allele admin
}}}


Use Bearer token for secured operations
{{{
$ curl -v -d "" -H "Authenticate: Bearer -jf9aqvkt9o6x" "http://localhost:8080/gl/load" ;echo
}}}

= Implementing a Authorization Server =
Some sample `OAuthProvider` implementations are available in the toy-portal project.

== Easy Steps ==
For authorization server
  # Add a dependency on gl-oauth-apache.jar
  # Implement an `OAuthProvider` -- Write the method `AuthorizationDetails getAuthorization(userid, realm)` to generate `AuthorizationDetail`s based on the user's groups or other security configuration.
  # Implement and configure handling for a "/validate" url
For resource server
  # Deploy the war generated by gl-service-webapp-custom/glsw-oauth
  # Configure it with system property "oauth.authorize.url" with the url for your "/validate" operation.
