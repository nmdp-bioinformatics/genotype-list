= Details =
The *toy-portal* webapp acts as the authorization server, but it has no authentication support.  The users and scopes are configured in the userid-scopes.txt file like

{{{
id=john,realm=immunogenomics,duration=3600,scope=locus
id=adam,realm=immunogenomics,duration=3600,scope=load allele admin
id=eve,realm=immunogenomics,duration=3600,scope=other
id=john,realm=toy,duration=3600,scope=read
id=adam,realm=toy,duration=3600,scope=write read admin POST
id=eve,realm=toy,duration=3600,scope=none
}}}

= Testing =
To build and launch wars
{{{
## at trunk
mvn install 
cd gl-jetty
mvn jetty:run
}}}

Perform POST operations to interact with authorization server.
{{{
$ curl -d "" "http://localhost:8080/toy-portal/oauth/get_token?userid=adam&realm=immunogenomics" ;echo
-jf9aqvkt9o6x
$ curl -d "" "http://localhost:8080/toy-portal/oauth/validate?token=-jf9aqvkt9o6x" ;echo
expires_in=3522,id=adam,duration=3600,realm=immunogenomics,scope=load allele admin
}}}


Use Bearer token for secured operations
{{{
$ curl -v -d "" -H "Authenticate: Bearer -jf9aqvkt9o6x" "http://localhost:8080/gl/load-imgt-alleles" ;echo
}}}
