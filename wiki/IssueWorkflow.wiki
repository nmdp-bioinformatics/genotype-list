#summary Care and feeding of the issue tracker.

= Issue workflow =


==== New ====

When creating a new issue, set Status to New and Owner to empty.


==== New --> Accepted ====

A new issue may be triaged.  If an issue is acceptable, set Status to Accepted.  If an issue is not acceptable, set Status to one of Invalid, Duplicate, or WontFix as appropriate.


==== Accepted --> Started ====

When work begins on an accepted issue, set Status to Started and Owner to the responsible team member.

Include the issue number in any subversion commit messages for commits related to a particular issue.  E.g.

{{{
$ svn commit -m "Issue 3 ; updating the specs on the rotary girdle" .
}}}

This creates a link to the issue from the source changes and revision pages.


==== Started --> Fixed ====

When work on a started issue is complete, set Status to Fixed and include the revision number in a comment.  E.g.

{{{
Fixed in revision 14.
}}}

This creates a link to the revision from the issue page.


==== Fixed --> Verified ====

Once an issue has been marked as fixed, the original submitter or a developer that did not work on the issue should review the fix, and if passes verification set Status to Verified.  Use the Code Review feature if helpful.
