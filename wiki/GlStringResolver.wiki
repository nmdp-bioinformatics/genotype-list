#summary Implementation of the GlStringResolver
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

The GL Service utilizes the {{{GlStringResolver}}} to look up a GL String in the cache and find or assign an id.

(statement about no guarantee of uniqueness and link to follow the controversy on the blog)

In brief, all implementations of the resolver:
 * Take in a GL String exactly as given by the user.
 * Check the cache for existence (dependent on the caching implementation).
   * If found in the cache: return the existing id.
   * If not found in the cache or the search times out: return a new id.

The following classes are _referenced_ by the GlStringResolver:
|| *Name* || *Function* ||
|| Varies. || Depends on the implementation. || 

==How it Works==
There are several different implementations ......... addmore

The implementation of the {{{GlstringResolver}}} is determined when the GLReader is initialized. 
{{{
GlstringGlReader(final GlstringResolver glstringResolver, final IdResolver idResolver, final GlRegistry glRegistry)
}}}

The {{{GlstringResolver}}} is also called by the Reader. 
{{{
final String id = glstringResolver.resolveLocus(glstring);
}}}
